Still a work in progress. Hoping I can train the model to proficiently and accurately predict Pareto optimal solutions to engineering design problems. Possibly branching out to financial uses too.
Using numpy and panda, two popular Python libraries, this code performs regression analysis using Gaussian Process models on data from multiple Excel/CSV files, comparing single-fidelity and multi-fidelity approaches. I am considering using __main__ guard for script execution and checking if the GaussianProcessRegressor supports multi-output natively; otherwise, might need to fit separate models for each output.
